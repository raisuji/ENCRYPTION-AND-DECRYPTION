# ENCRYPTION-AND-DECRYPTION
Encryption of data on images provides a safe and secure transmission of data between the sending and receiving party. The data/text which the sender wants to transmit is selected first and then an image is chosen from the current mobile device. The chosen text is then encrypted in the image such that the data is not visible to any third party. After encryption is performed, the image is sent to receiving party and the receiver decrypts the data using the key given by the sender. This decryption process can only be performed by an authenticated receiver using this application.
